This is an example from the 2024 January exam 

It is almost identical with the ex1, with the difference of the direction of the roller


The main tricky bit is the roller direction. 

in this case the 
- roller direction is set to one (1) which means fixing the normal direction 
- roller angle is set to the direction plane to -63.4349 degrees (atan (4,2))

The end result is the same with  setting
- the roller direction to 2 (fixing the axis parallel to provided angle)
- setting the angle equal to 23.56
