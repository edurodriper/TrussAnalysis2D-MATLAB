Introduction
------------

**npp_2d_truss_analysis** is an open-source software tool designed for the  solving of trusses with features like:

-  inclined roller supports
-  offset pin supports
-  prescribed displacements
-  plotting of Truss problem (with geometry, loads and supports)
-  deformation plotting
-  forces and reaction plotting

Developers
----------

The python version of the truss analysis project has been developed by:

- N. Papadakis: In charge of software design and package maintenance.

the work is based on Eduaardo's Pereira's repoistory for matlab called [TrussAnalysis2d-MATLAB](https://github.com/edurodriper/TrussAnalysis2D-MATLAB).
